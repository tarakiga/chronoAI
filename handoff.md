### Overview

This document tracks the development progress of the ChronoAI project, following the phased plan derived from the PRD. It serves as a handoff document between development sessions and a single source of truth for project status.

### Current Status

**Current Phase:** Phase 1: The Core Notification Engine (No UI)
**Next Step:** Implement the core TTS & Volume Control logic in `src/core/tts_engine.py`.

---

## Phase 0: Project Setup & Foundation

- [x] **Environment Setup:** Git repository and Python virtual environment initialized.
- [x] **Install Core Dependencies:** `PyQt5`, `APScheduler`, `pyttsx3`, `pydub`, `keyring`, `google-api-python-client`, etc., added to `requirements.txt`.
- [x] **Establish Project Structure:** Directory structure created as per the development plan.

## Phase 1: The Core Notification Engine (No UI)

- [x] **TTS & Volume Control (`tts_engine.py`):**
  - [x] Create a class wrapping `pyttsx3`.
  - [x] Implement `speak(text, volume)` and `stop()` methods.
- [x] **Scheduler (`scheduler.py`):**
  - [x] Implement a singleton wrapper for `APScheduler`.
  - [x] Create functions to `add_job`, `remove_job`, and manage the scheduler lifecycle.
- [x] **Proof of Concept Script:**
  - [x] Wrote `poc_test.py` to test the scheduler and TTS engine with the escalating notification sequence.

## Phase 2: Calendar Integration & Authentication

- [x] **Authentication Manager (`auth_manager.py`):**
  - [x] Implemented secure token storage using the `keyring` library.
- [x] **Google Calendar Service (`google_cal.py`):**
  - [x] Implemented OAuth 2.0 flow with secure token storage.
  - [x] Implemented `fetch_events()` function with standardized parsing.
- [x] **Zoho Calendar Service (`zoho_cal.py`):**
  - [x] Implemented OAuth 2.0 flow with secure token storage.
  - [x] Implemented `fetch_events()` function with standardized parsing.
- [x] **Event Manager (`event_manager.py`):**
  - [x] Implemented logic to merge and sort events from all connected calendars.

---

## Phase 3: Building the User Interface (UI)

- [x] **System Tray Icon (`tray_icon.py`):**
  - [x] Created a persistent `QSystemTrayIcon` with a context menu.
- [x] **Main Dashboard (`main_window.py`):**
  - [x] Built the main window UI to display today's events.
- [x] **Settings Window (`settings_ui.py`):**
  - [x] Created the UI for all user-configurable settings.

---

## Phase 4: Tying It All Together

- [x] **Main Application Logic (`main.py`):**
  - [x] Implemented background calendar sync on a schedule.
  - [x] Implemented logic to schedule notifications for upcoming events.
- [ ] **Implement the Interactive Notification Flow:**
- [x] **Implement the Interactive Notification Flow:**
  - [x] Created the `NotificationPopup` window.
  - [x] Connected the "Acknowledge" button to stop the audio escalation and speak event details.
  - [x] Implemented the timeout logic for unacknowledged notifications.
- [ ] **Final Polish & Testing:**
- [x] **Final Polish & Testing:**
  - [x] Tested all user stories and edge cases.
  - [x] Packaged the application for distribution.
